# tools — checking the site without opening a browser yourself

None of this ships. It is here so the next person to touch the site can see
what they changed instead of hoping. Every bug in `super-ouissy.js` was found
by running these, not by reading the code.

## Running them

```
python3 -m http.server 8899          # from the repo root
cd tools && npm i playwright-core    # once
node regress.js                      # then any script below
```

Chromium is at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`. Google
Fonts is blocked by the egress proxy, so every script aborts non-localhost
requests and navigates with `domcontentloaded` — without that the page never
fires `load`. Press Start 2P and Great Vibes fall back to system faces in
these runs; that is the harness, not the site.

## What each one does

| script | what it tells you |
|---|---|
| `regress.js` | walks every screen that existed before Super Ouissy — intro, gate, book, hub, maze, adventure, keepsake — on desktop and on an iPhone, and checks each still builds with no page errors and no horizontal scroll. Run this before any push. |
| `mech.js` | eighteen assertions on the game itself: hearts, gift blocks, stomping, growing, breaking bricks, pits, the cloud that catches her on Easy, Hard's clock and extra spikes, the moat, the whole boss fight. |
| `flow.js` | plays all three worlds through to the ending and checks the results cards, the saved best time and the chapter being marked done. |
| `layout.js` | measures the stage, the touch pad and the HUD at five real device sizes and reports anything that overflows. |
| `screens.js` | screenshots the how-to, world card, pause menu, results and ending. |
| `level.js`, `play.js` | screenshot the game canvas itself at a given world and position. |
| `sheet.js` | dumps a contact sheet of every sprite, for looking at the art. |

## Two things that will waste your afternoon otherwise

**requestAnimationFrame runs at about 3fps in a headless container.** Any test
that waits on wall-clock time runs in slow motion and proves nothing. Set
`window.__soTestDrive = true` and advance the world with `window.__soPump(seconds, keys)`
instead — it steps the fixed timestep directly. The `__so*` hooks are
documented at the bottom of `super-ouissy.js`.

**`page.screenshot()` hangs** while the game loop is painting: playwright waits
for the element box to be stable and never gets it. Either call
`window.__soHalt()` first and capture through CDP (`Page.captureScreenshot`),
as `screens.js` does, or pull the canvas out with `toDataURL` and skip
playwright's screenshot entirely, as `play.js` does.
